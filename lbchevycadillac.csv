Source: KBB.com  * Premium look inside and out; quiet interior; comfortable highway ride; powerful available V6 engine; spacious and adjustable backseat. Source: Edmunds  * The 2014 GMC Terrain is designed to be the perfect combination of luxury and utility and it all starts with distinct, bold design features and striking grille. Every Terrain model has standard aluminum wheels to reduce weight and enhance fuel economy. The Terrain's available programmable power liftgate opens to your desired height with the push of a button. Projector beam headlights and fog lamps keep visibility high regardless of weather conditions.  The Terrain has a refined interior which features a color touch radio and an acoustic design meant to minimize outside noise. As a crossover, the terrain has the comfort and utility of a small SUV. A 60/40 split and folding second-row maximizes space and there is up to 39.9 inches of rear leg room. The steering wheel features conveniently mounted steering wheel controls. The available 8-Way power driver's seat and remote activated heated front seats promise a comfortable ride regardless of trip length.  At the heart of Terrain's performance and power is the 2.4L I-4 VVT DI Engine or opt for the available 3.6L V-6 VVT SIDI engine. The 6-speed transmission offers a wide ratio spread for power in the low gears and efficiency in the high gears. The Standard rear vision camera displays in the center stack touch-screen, and alloys for easy, confidant parallel parking. Finally, the four-wheel independent suspension offers a smooth, steady ride and a precise feel for the road.  The Terrain is equipped with 6 airbags, including thorax and side-impact. Plus, anti-lock brakes come standard. The available Forward Collision Alert provides an audible and visual signal when a potential collision is detected. The Lane Departure Warning informs a driver when they have wandered from a lane without using a turn signal.

Source: KBB.com  * Less expensive than most competitors; smooth ride; nimble handling; quick acceleration; comfortable front seats. Source: Edmunds  * From headlights to taillights the stylish Nissan Rogue maintains a perfect blend of classy and sporty, for a look that's easy-on-the-eyes. The color-matched, aerodynamic rear spoiler helps reduce turbulence and drag while enhancing a sporty appearance. The chrome grille gives your Rogue's exterior the durability it needs while maintaining its shine and available 18 inch 5-split-spoke aluminum-alloy wheels give Rogue just the right amount of sophistication. Cargo versatility is right behind you. The standard 60/40 split fold-down rear seat allows a bigger cargo area with room for longer items. Smart details like illuminated steering wheel audio controls and an ergonomically shaped shift knob make for a rewarding long-term relationship. The Rogue also has a completely integrated interface for your iPod, and an input conveniently located in the center console armrest for easy access. The Rogue is an exercise in practicality and efficiency. The 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine gets a remarkable 28 MPG (highway) and is backed by 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. The Rogue's power steering system adjusts sensitivity according to the speed you are traveling. It becomes more nimble at low speeds, making parking and reversing easier. Plus, the intuitive all-wheel drive (AWD) recognizes the difference between various driving conditions and responds accordingly. So you get extra grip when you need it and maximum efficiency when you don't. Protecting the most precious cargo, the Nissan Advanced Air Bag System (AABS) includes dual-stage supplemental front air bags with seat belt sensors and an occupant-classification sensor. Also, roof-mounted curtain supplemental air bags provide head protection for both rows of outboard occupants. Finally, front-seat Active Head Restraints help reduce the chance of whiplash injuries. With the Nissan Rogue you are sure to arrive in style.

Source: Edmunds  * If you don’t already like the 2015 Silverado for the mere fact that it’s a Chevy, this pickup makes a compelling case for itself with a sophisticated yet intuitive infotainment system, refined interior and an available V8 engine with class-leading power output. Source: KBB.com  * The Silverado is the truck you know and trust. The modern body is chiseled and sleek at the same time. The dramatic stacked double grille in front is complimented with vertically stacked headlights on either side, outlined in chrome. The bumper is contoured as well. Also, its tough persona is further accentuated by the geometric lines of its new sculpted fenders and dual power dome hood. The Silverado currently comes in three models: Short Box Crew Cab, Standard Box Crew Cab, and Standard Box Double Cab. Each has six trims with the 1WT as the Base and the LTZ Z71 as the top-of-the-line option. Knowing that it's what's under the hood that counts, the Silverado is stacked with impressive engines. The 1WT, 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 come standard with the 4.3L EcoTec3 V6, with 6-speed automatic transmission. The LTZ and LTZ Z71 come standard with the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, which is also an option for the other trims. Don't forget the 6.2 EcoTec V8 with 420hp. The Max Trailering Package, offered with both V8 engines, offers class-leading trailering capacity of up to 12,000 pounds. The ride is quiet and the interior more comfortable than ever. The center controls have been updated with an improved layout and are easy to reach. Chevy's MyLink system is an extremely intuitive and helpful system to use. It allows you to control your music, make calls, and navigate to a number of stored destinations all by using your voice. 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 trims get a 4.2-inch color screen to go with it, and the LTZ and LTZ Z71 get an 8-inch color touchscreen. In terms of safety all models come with 4-wheel ABS disc brakes with Duralife rotors, StabiliTrak with Electronic Sway Control and Hill Start Assist.

But the Canyon is refined, with arguably the nicest interior in its segment. Source: KBB.com  * Comfortable but confident ride quality; many available high-tech features; fuel-efficient engines; classy-looking interior; maneuverable size. Source: Edmunds  * The all-new 2015 GMC Canyon will redefine the small truck category with segment-leading features that make it more capable and versatile than any other midsize pickup on the market. Canyon's 305hp 3.6L V6 engine is the most powerful in its segment. When equipped with the trailering package, it offers a Best-in-Class Max Trailering rating of 7,000 lbs. The 2.5L engine is the most powerful in the segment with 200hp. Both engines feature direct injection and variable valve timing. A 6-speed manual transmission is standard on the 2WD SL and extended cab base Canyon trim levels, and an automatic transmission is standard on all other models. Canyon's cabin is precisely crafted, exceptionally quiet and comfortable, and designed to the highest standards. The craftsmanship, attention to details and premium materials are what you expect from all GMC vehicles. Canyon features inlaid, triple-sealed doors, thick windshield and side glass, and liquid-applied sound deadener to help reduce wind noise inside the cab and keep the road noise out. The Canyon was designed to be efficient and maneuverable, yet make a powerful and lasting first impression. Manage your cargo and protect your truck bed with the largest cargo box in a midsized pickup, integrated CornerStep rear bumper for easy access to the box, and available EZ-Lift and Lower tailgate. OnStar offers available 4G LTE built-in Wi-Fi hotspot so you stay connected to the internet and your favorite apps anywhere you go. The standard Rear Vision Camera helps to provide clarity and peace of mind while maneuvering and parking. The available 8-inch-diagonal Color Touch Radio with next-generation IntelliLink lets you customize your media and connect with unprecedented ease.
